**Hackathon:** CBIT VibeathonX 2025  
**Team:** CannonNova (CBIT DSC)  
**Domain:** Health & Education  
**Project Type:** AI + Web + Emotion Recognition  

---

##  Overview

**JoyVerse** is an AI-powered **expression tracker** and adaptive learning platform that helps educators and therapists understand how children with **dyslexia** and **autism** feel during gamified learning sessions.

While most tools only record scores and accuracy, **JoyVerse** goes beyond ‚Äî capturing **emotional engagement** in real time to make learning **personalized**, **empathetic**, and **effective**.

##  Problem Statement

Traditional learning analytics overlook the emotional state of children.  
Students with learning disorders like **dyslexia** or **autism** often struggle silently ‚Äî their frustration, stress, or disengagement goes unnoticed.  

- 8% of Indian children (ages 6‚Äì19) have Specific Learning Disorders.  
- 30% of such children face emotional or behavioral challenges.  
- Emotional well-being directly affects learning outcomes.  

Hence, there is a **need for an intelligent system** that not only tracks performance but also understands *how the child feels while learning*.

##  Solution: JoyVerse

An **AI-based expression tracker** that:
(Currrently avaliable)
- Captures **real-time facial expressions** using the webcam.  
- Detects emotions such as **happiness, sadness, anger, and fear**.

- Dynamically adjusts **game difficulty and pace** based on emotions. (Yet to do) 
- Provides **emotion analytics** and **therapist insights**.
